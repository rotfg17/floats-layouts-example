<div class="float-description">
    <p class="des-float">After the nonavian dinosaurs became extinct, mammals became the dominant life forms. The first felinelike mammal, Proailurus, evolved about 30 million years ago. It is thought that all true cat species evolved from this small civetlike predator. <br><br>

        Cats that resemble today’s felids first appeared in the early Pliocene Epoch (5.3 to 3.6 million years ago), and they have continued into present times with remarkably few changes. The original design of fang and claw, flexible backbone, muscular strength, and agility allowed felids to survive and adapt to the changes brought by each new era. Adaptations have occurred with changes in prey, but the basic body type has stayed the same.</p>
    <br>

    <p class="des-float">It is noteworthy that the ancestors of the other common household pet, the dog, were social animals that lived together in packs in which there was subordination to a leader, and, over time, the dog has readily transferred its allegiance from pack leader to human master. The cat, however, has not yielded as readily to subjugation. Moreover, the bodies, abilities, and temperaments of dogs have changed radically in the more than 30,000 years since they were domesticated, while domestic cats are almost identical to their wild counterparts. Cats show little of the infantilization of facial features seen in dogs and have retained much of their independent nature. In fact, the felid generally thought to be the closest ancestor of the domestic cat is a small wildcat native to the Middle East and Africa (Felis silvestris lybica) that is genetically virtually identical to domestics and readily interbreeds with them, so much so that, in some areas, the wildcat is in danger of ceasing to exist as a pure species. Consequently, cats have retained their independent nature and can thrive as predators in the wild today. This is why feral cats abound and why experts do not consider the cat to be a fully domesticated animal.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="des-float">The earliest known association between cats and humans likely dates to the origins of agriculture in the Middle East, about 15,000–10,000 years ago. Although the animal was certainly a source of meat and pelts, a partnership of sorts eventually developed between humans and cats, one based on mutual need. When humans gave up living as hunter-gatherers and began relying on agriculture, cats were attracted to the rodents feeding on crops and stored grain. Humans needed their grain protected from rodents, and cats needed a ready food source.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="des-float">Just like their human counterparts, every single dog in the world is perfect and adorable in its own way. Picking the cutest among them is like picking the cutest baby in the nursery. That is to say, the one that belongs to you and your family is undoubtedly the most breathtaking, irresistible creature in the lot!</p>
    <br>

    <p class="des-float">Still, we’ll take any opportunity to scroll through pictures of precious pups in a futile but fun effort to identify the cutest dog breeds on the planet. Those paws and pads! Those fuzzy bellies and tails! Those wet noses and floppy ears and happy tongues… we could just eat them all up. Every last one of these doggos is the goodest boy or girl — hands down. Which one is the cutest isn't a matter of fact, but rather a matter of personal opinion. And absolutely all dogs deserve a lifetime of play, treats, love, and loyalty as essential members of the family.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p class="des-float">The dog breeds on our list include some pure breeds, some mixed breeds and some perfectly lovable and adorable dogs hardly deserving of their less-than-flawless reputations! Don't forget the next great love of your life might be waiting for you right now at your local animal shelter.</p>

    <br>
    <p class="des-float">The dog (Canis familiaris or Canis lupus familiaris) is a domesticated descendant of the wolf. Also called the domestic dog, it is derived from extinct gray wolves, and the gray wolf is the dog's closest living relative. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans. Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago, which was before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.[</p>
    <br>
    <p class="des-float">The dog has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They perform many roles for humans, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and the military, companionship, therapy, and aiding disabled people. Over the millennia, dogs became uniquely adapted to human behavior, and the human–canine bond has been a topic of frequent study. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet of "man's best friend".</p>
